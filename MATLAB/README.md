# Usage

There are four main scripts in this directory:
1) `surfActiveLearning.m` and 2) `classActiveLearning.m` runs the surface and classifier active learning
respectively. There are a number of algorithmic settings. Please follow the paper to identify and change these settings. By default most of these are set to re-create 
the tests in the paper. Visualisations will start automatically when the `Dimension` option is set to `'2D'`.

3) The full two-step emulator is run when `ApPredict_GP.m` script is run. 4) The script `drugBlock.m` re-creates the drug block excercise from the paper.
